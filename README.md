  Netflix Clone Built Using React.JS & Firebase
</h1>

<p><font size="3">
  This is a Netflix clone website built using <strong><em>React.JS</em></strong> as a Front-end & <strong><em>Firebase</em></strong> as Back-end. It's not a replica, and it     doesn't have all the features of Netflix website. It's a similar version of Netflix with some of the features.This project is showing my abilities in React.JS to build something advanced like Netflix. It contains the home page, a random header, Youtube trailer player.
